\section{Conclusion}
\label{chap03sec:conclusion}

In this work, we studied the internal working of YouTube's bitrate adaptation algorithm, by identifying important parameters and exploring their roles.
We observed that YouTube adapts segment length in addition to quality level, a behavior not been reported earlier.
As an implication, we observed that data wastage for a playback session is significantly lower than estimated previously.
We further provided an analytical model, augmented with a machine learning based classifier, to predict data consumption in adavance for a video playback session.
As an immediate future direction, we would like to explore other important implications of segment length adaption for YouTube.
