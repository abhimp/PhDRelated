\section{Summary}
\label{sec:chap03:summary}
In this chapter, we have performed three different experimental studies to understand the performance of existing ABR algorithms over today's Internet. First, we have explored the YouTube

In this chapter we analyze YouTube video streaming system along with the effect of new transport protocol QUIC. We found that YouTube adapt quality as well as the segment length according to the network quality. In our analysis with QUIC and DASH, we found that current ABRs may not perform well enough if the underlying transport protocol is QUIC. We have performed a thorough analysis of the problem and present in this chapter. We also performed a pilot study on the effect of mobility to the smart devices and find out the relationship between different parameters.

With the above context, we design a new ABRs technology call EnDASH. We will discuss about it in depth in the next chapter.
