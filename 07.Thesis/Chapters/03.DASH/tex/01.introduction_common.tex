\blue{Online video streaming service is one of the most popular online services on the Internet. As per Sandvine's\footnote{\url{https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/downloads/phenomena/2018-phenomena-report.pdf}} report, video streaming takes almost 58\% of total down-stream traffic of the global Internet traffic. Google's YouTube, already a part of the common Internet parlance, has emerged as the largest player in the mobile video market, accounting for 40--70\% of total video traffic across most mobile networks\footnote{\url{https://www.ericsson.com/assets/local/mobility-report/documents/2016/ericsson-mobility-report-november-2016.pdf}}.
Not surprisingly, YouTube has garnered significant interest in the research community over the years, furnishing studies which explore various aspects of the service -- a large majority of which focus on its video playback mechanism.
However, the interest in YouTube's video streaming behavior is far from satiated -- a phenomenon largely propelled by YouTube's practice of incessant technical evolution.
