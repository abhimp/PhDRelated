\subsection{Summary}
In this section, we developed a systematic analysis of web based adaptive streaming performance over QUIC and compared it with TCP enabled video streaming. We developed a testbed to automatically download $175$ YouTube videos with different quality levels and of different sizes using both QUIC enabled and TCP enabled streaming. From thorough analysis, we observed that although QUIC improves data download performance even at poor network condition, the benefits do not get directly translated to adaptive video streaming over the web, when QoE metrics are considered. 

This section primarily analyzed the performance from the context of YouTube ABR streaming. In the next section, we discuss about a more generalized analysis, where we consider various recent ABR streaming algorithms.
