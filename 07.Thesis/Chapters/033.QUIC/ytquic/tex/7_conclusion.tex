\subsection{Summary}
In this section, we developed a systematic analysis of web based adaptive streaming performance over \ac{QUIC} and compared it with \ac{TCP} enabled video streaming. We developed a testbed to automatically download $175$ YouTube videos with different quality levels and of different sizes using both \ac{QUIC} enabled and \ac{TCP} enabled streaming. From thorough analysis, we observed that although \ac{QUIC} improves data download performance even at poor network condition, the benefits do not get directly translated to adaptive video streaming over the web, when \ac{QoE} metrics are considered. 

This section primarily analyzed the performance from the context of YouTube \ac{ABR} streaming. In the next section, we discuss about a more generalized analysis, where we consider various recent \ac{ABR} streaming algorithms.
