%This thesis would not have seen the light of day without the help and support of many people. I would like to express my gratitude towards my supervisor Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar for her immense help, motivation, and guidance to carry out this work. Her continued support in the form of discussion, constructive criticism, and clear understanding has helped me to proceed in the right direction. I am really indebted to her for giving me a wide exposure to the field of natural language processing and helping me to contribute constructively to this field. Without her invaluable advice and supervision, it would not be possible to complete this work. I am grateful to Prof. Pabitra Mitra, Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay, Prof. Pawan Goyal, and Prof. Shamik Sural for serving on my doctoral scrutiny committee and for their valuable advise and suggestions. Finally, I would like to thank Prof. Sudebkumar Prasant Pal, Prof. Debdeep Mukhopadhyay, Prof. Dipanwita Roy Chowdhury, Prof. Pallab Dasgupta and Prof. Niloy Ganguly for teaching me different subjects that helped me in carrying out my research. I would like to thank Bappada, Ashokda, Swapanbabu, Shibuda, Prasunda, Prasenjitda, Durgada and all other office members for being helpful in sorting out all the official work.

%My greatest strength comes from my family. My parents have been my greatest source of inspiration. Without their patience, constant encouragement, support, unparalleled love, prayers and well wishes, I could never have completed this endeavour. I am what I am because of them. I would also like to express my gratitude towards my aunts, brothers and sisters-in-law for their constant support and encouragement. I am grateful towards my niece and nephew for being  constant sources of smile for me.\\\\
