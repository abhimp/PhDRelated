In the age of low-cost, high-end smartphones, smart televisions (TVs), cheap data plans, and COVID-19 pandemic, video streaming platforms over the Internet have emerged as an essential service for online meetings as well as for entertainment. Most online video streaming services are adaptive in nature, wherein adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms are used for maintaining high Quality of Experience (QoE), along with improving the data usage and reducing energy consumption. From the conceptualization of ABR streaming algorithms in 2009, several researchers have proposed different versions of these algorithms and architectural changes to facilitate their implementations on various devices. Nevertheless, there are many open rooms still available and pertinent for improving video streaming systems to boost their scalability to support millions of devices while supporting better on-device resource utilization. This thesis investigates the fundamentals behind different ABR video streaming services while supporting optimizations and improvements in their performance for large-scale usage.

Video constitutes the most considerable fraction of the global Internet and mobile traffic. To support the continuous increase in the number of video subscribers, every player on the Internet must adopt improved technologies. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, various over-the-top (OTT) streaming providers had decided to drop their top-qualities to reduce the amount of Internet traffic to support the higher number of work-from-home users. This raises the doubt whether the existing ABR algorithms alone cannot handle the excess bandwidth requirements. Although the answer remains elusive, the doubt establishes the importance of the domain. It motivates one to dig deeper to understand how the existing system works and the specific measures to be adopted for its improvement.

YouTube is one of the major video streaming providers and pioneers of web-based video streaming services. As per their recent press release, YouTube serves nearly a billion videos to $30$ million users every day. Hence, a deep dive into how YouTube serves video to users adaptively is expected to yield answers to several intuitions. As the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of YouTube's adaptive streaming service, in this work, we have first performed thorough experiments to understand the same. We use our homegrown tools to get a request-response pair during video playback in a browser for $~500$ YouTube videos and have subsequently analyzed them. Our analysis shows that YouTube uses an opportunistic upscale and conservative downscale of video quality based on the network quality and adapts the segment length before changing the rate. We also observed that YouTube sometimes tries to download the same segment at different qualities, which can cause data wastage. However, our calculation reveals that the ensuing data wastage is negligible.

Currently, Google uses Quick Internet UDP Connect (QUIC) as the default transport protocol for all its services from the Chrome browser. In the second work, we experiment to determine its impact on video streaming services, especially on the ABR algorithms. The experiment has two parts. First, we have tested over YouTube and found that QUIC provides better video quality with lower rebuffering than TCP. In the second part, we have compared popular ABR algorithms' performance over QUIC and TCP and found that these ABR algorithms are not well suited for QUIC. When we dig deep, we realized that the problem lies in the userspace implementation of QUIC. In this work, we also explore the impact of video streaming during mobility on the device's energy efficiency, particularly smartphones. We study the power consumption in various commodity smartphones while playing YouTube videos with different mobility states in other cities. In this study, we observe that YouTube does not care about the instantaneous throughput or the radio state, which can cause a severe impact on power consumption.

With the last observations, we then design the EnDASH ABR algorithm that reduces the power consumption during the video streaming by carefully scheduling the segment downloading based on various device-related parameters, including cellular radio, battery, and device movement. EnDASH divides the entire playback session into slots. At the beginning of each slot, it first estimates the average throughput and then selects the maximum playback buffer-length based on the last download slot's observations. The change in the playback buffer-length triggers the rescheduling during segment downloading. EnDASH also has a module that decides the video quality for each segment, which further reduces the power consumption. It requires three different learning engines, a) Throughput estimation engine, b) Buffer length prediction engine, and c) quality selection engine. The throughput estimation engine is based on random forest reinforcement learning. The buffer length prediction engine and the quality selection engine are designed based on an actor-critic based recurrence neural network. We find that EnDASH provides better energy efficiency during evaluation than the existing ABR algorithm with a slight compromise in the QoE.

In the thesis's final contribution, we develop FLiDASH, a federated adaptive live streaming system that exploits players' locality by forming coalitions. We observe that mega-events live streamers are localized, and most of the cases are connected via a local network. However, the current setup does not exploit the local network. Instead, every player downloads the segment on their own. FLiDASH utilizes the local network information to find out players who can communicate without involving the Internet. Such players having similar quality targets form a coalition. Every player in a coalition contributes to the QoE's improvement by downloading the best quality video that it can download. We use the moving leader concept, where the leader is responsible for downloading a segment and deciding the leader for the next segment. These two algorithms work in a way so that a player with the lowest download speed gets to download the furthest segment in the long run. Our evaluation reveals that FLiDASH can improve the QoE for a coalition while reducing the server and the network load. We also find that every player gains QoE and average quality using FLiDASH than using any other ABR algorithms.

In summary, this thesis contributes to the literature from two different aspects. First, it analyzes the existing streaming mechanisms and ABR algorithms to check and explore their performance over today's Internet. Second, we propose two advancements over the current systems -- (a) from the context of energy efficiency over a smartphone and (b) for improving the QoE and reducing the network overhead during live streaming. Although this thesis opens up and explores new research in video streaming, there are still many unexplored areas, which can be taken up for extending the research and developments in this direction.
