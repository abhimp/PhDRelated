    abstract={Vehicular networks are a rapidly growing technology with vehicle manufacturers already taking steps for its implementation. However, adding IP services to vehicular networks remains an issue. This is in part due to the mobile IP handover causing overhead and latencies unsuitable for the faster movement of vehicles. Frequent topological changes caused by this movement require smooth IP handovers due to the regularity in which they occur. In this paper, we propose a predictive handover utilizing a movement prediction method to conduct the costly handover ahead of time, thus providing a consistent IP connection. The approach is tested and compared in a variety of simulated vehicle network environments. Results show an overall improvement in network performance with handover latency greatly reduced.},

    abstract = {Despite the explosive growth of mobile devices and applications in recent years, today's Internet provides little intrinsic support for seamless mobility. Prior solutions to addressing this problem either handle only a subset of endpoint mobility scenarios or require nontrivial changes to legacy infrastructure. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of msocket, a system that allows communicating endpoints to move across network locations arbitrarily while maintaining disruption-tolerant connectivity without any change to legacy operating systems or network infrastructure. msocket supports pre-lookup, connect-time, individual, and simultaneous mobility of one or both endpoints across multihomed network addresses, and enables seamless mobile-to-mobile communication despite the presence of address-translating middleboxes. We have implemented msocket as a user-level socket library and our evaluation shows that: (1) msocket recovers from mobility of one or both endpoint(s) in roughly two round-trips; (2) msocket's multipath scheduler greatly enhances user-perceived performance or power consumption in multihomed settings; and (3) msocket imposes little additional overhead over traditional TCP/IP sockets.},

    abstract = {MPTCP has been proposed recently as a mechanism for sup- porting transparently multiple connections to the applica- tion layer. It is under discussion at the IETF. We show, however, that the current MPTCP suffers from two prob- lems: (P1) Upgrading some TCP users to MPTCP can re- duce the throughput of others without any benefit to the upgraded users, which is a symptom of not being Pareto optimal; and (P2) MPTCP users could be excessively ag- gressive towards TCP users. We attribute these problems to the linked-increases algorithm (LIA) of MPTCP and, more specifically, to an excessive amount of traffic transmitted over congested paths. The design of LIA forces a tradeoff between optimal resource pooling and responsiveness. We revisit the problem and show that it is possible to provide these two proper- ties simultaneously. We implement the resulting algorithm, called opportunistic linked increases algorithm (OLIA), in the Linux kernel, and we study its performance over our testbed, by simulations and by theoretical analysis. We prove that OLIA is Pareto-optimal and satisfies the design goals of MPTCP. Hence it can avoid the problems P1 and P2. Ourmeasurements and simulations indicate thatMPTCP with OLIA is as responsive and non-flappy as MPTCP with LIA, and that it solves problems P1 and P2.},
