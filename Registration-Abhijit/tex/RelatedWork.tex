\acrshort{tcp} have two basic problems. 1) \acrshort{tcp} is tightly coupled with \acrshort{ip}, 2) \acrshort{tcp}'s slow-start mechanism is ill suited for short-lived connection. 
To solve the first problem. i.e. decoupling \acrshort{tcp} and \acrshort{ip}, first approach is to solve it from network. So, we got Mobile IP, \acrfull{hip}, \acrfull{shim6}. These protocols try to hide the information that underlying path has been changed. It \acrshort{tcp}'s congestion control suffers from this.

Another approach is to solve it from transport layer. For this we got \acrfull{sctp} and \acrfull{mptcp}. \acrshort{sctp} is similar to \acrshort{tcp}, but it provide multi-homing and multi-path for more reliability. It is not used because it is doesn't support \acrfull{nat} well. Application needed add support for this protocol. It wasn't drop in replacement for \acrshort{tcp}. \acrshort{mptcp} is drop-in replacement for \acrshort{mptcp}. It is almost traneparent to the application. If operating system support \acrshort{mptcp}, any exisiting application can start using \acrshort{mptcp}.
