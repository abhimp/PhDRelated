\section{Conclusion and Future work}
Viscous is a bridge between \acrshort{mptcp} and \acrshort{quic}. It provides advantages from both the protocol i.e. it is multipath and provides better suitable for short-lived connections. It performs much better than \acrshort{mptcp} or \acrshort{tcp}. It also performs well enough for long-lived connections.

\subsection{Future Works}
Viscous is promising, but we need to do few improvement on it. It is required a better path scheduler. It is also needed to improve the congestion control algorithm. We need to implement the full mobility support.
