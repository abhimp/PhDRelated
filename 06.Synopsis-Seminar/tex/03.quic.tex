\section{Transport Protocols and Mobility Choices for ABR Streaming: Performance vs Energy Efficiency}
Any ABR take decision based on the directly or indirectly observed network throughput. However, this throughput is highly depends on the underlying transport protocol QUIC or TCP. On the other hand, the performance of an ABR algorithm can indirectly impact the power consumption of smartphones due to the nature of the radio resource controller (RRC).
