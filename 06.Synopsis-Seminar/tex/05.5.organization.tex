\section{Organization of the Thesis}

In this section, we provide a brief description of the organization of the thesis.
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Chapter 2} provide details of online video streaming system and different ABR algorithm developed in the past. Moreover, it iterates over the merits and demerits of the proposed solution to the problem broadly linked with this thesis.
	\item {\bf Chapter 3} present the study on YouTube video streaming service and analyses the adaptation technique taken by YouTube.
	\item {\bf Chapter 3} performs a study to analyze the performance difference between two transport protocols, TCP and QUIC, on the video streaming system, both YouTube and DASH. We further analyze the energy consumption by a smartphone during online video streaming in various scenarios.
	\item {\bf Chapter 4} present a novel ABR algorithm EnDASH to reduce energy consumption during the online streaming by optimizing the segmented schedule in buffer length.
	\item {\bf Chapter 5} proposes a DASH based video streaming system which exploits the locality information to improve the video QoE and decrease the network usage by sharing segment among local players. It also describes a novel approach to form a coalition among local players and decide bitrate for the entire coalition.
	\item {\bf Chapter 7} concludes the thesis by summarizing our contributions and listing down the possible future directions.
