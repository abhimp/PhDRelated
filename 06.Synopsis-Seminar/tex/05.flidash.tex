\section{Federated Adaptive Bitrate Live Streaming over Locality Sensitive Playback Coalitions}\red{Live streaming is a unique service in the Internet which is alternative to TV broadcast yet more flexible. Few live streaming provider allow ability add custom delay. However, most popular flavor of live streaming is without any user defined delays. The live stream have a unique property of synchronous playback by millions of players. In case of mega event, we find another interesting property that many player belongs same local networks. There is two special case exists a) Internet on cable where users have different connection even though they are connected via local networks, b) shared Internet connection where multiple user/player share same Intenet backbone. We want to develop a DASH based live streaming system where players forms coalition if they are connected via local network and stream the live video as a group. Incase of large network, Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) server will be use to find appropriate players. Our goal is to improve quality }
