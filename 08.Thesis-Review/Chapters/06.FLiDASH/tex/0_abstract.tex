Live video broadcasts to particular communities or targeted audiences many-at-a-times indulge a cluster of localities from where the end-users are interested in participating. In this paper, we leverage this idea to develop a system called \textit{Federated Live Streaming over DASH} (\our) which forms end-users coalitions based on the locality of the network connectivity (like a set of end-users behind a common core-network service gateway). In \our, the coalition members stream the live data collectively based on a federated adaptive bitrate streaming mechanism where the coalition as a whole decides the optimal bitrate for video streaming and distributes the download overhead among its members. We have thoroughly evaluated {\our} in an emulated setup, and observe a 40\% improvement in the live streaming QoE with a 20\% reduction in the network traffic usage. 
%Streaming live videos to targeted audiences has become popular with advances of online social streaming applications such as YouTube live, Instagram, Periscope, Twitch.tv, Meerkat, etc. as well as the usage of online platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, Webex, etc. for conducting online lectures at the educational institutes during COVID-19 pandemic. For many of such applications, typically, majority of the end-users are either from the same locality or form a cluster of localities. In this paper, we leverage this idea and develop a middlebox-free federated live streaming framework where the video players which are close to each other with a common network backbone form a coalition. The members of the coalition collectively and collaboratively stream the video using adaptive bitrate streaming. Although there exists a number of peer-to-peer networking solution to construct such a coalition, the major challenge here is to develop the adaptive streaming protocol on top of the coalition without taking help from any Internet middleboxes or central controllers that limit the scalability. Accordingly, we develop a framework called \textit{Federated Live Streaming over DASH} (\our) which reduces the total amount of data directly downloaded from the content server and thus reduces the backbone traffic load while improving the overall QoE of the end users. \our\; has been implemented and thoroughly tested over different realistic emulation environments, and we observe a significant performance gain in the live streaming quality in comparison with various other baselines.

%For example, a video where the director of an organization is giving a talk in a conference, majority of the viewers will be typically from the different offices of that organization.
