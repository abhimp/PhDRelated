\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:chap05:conclusion}
%\begin{enumerate}
%     \item \textcolor{red}{Motivation results needed}
%     Demonstration of the fact that client side does not always have necessary information
%     \item usefulness of stateless and stateful in case of handover
%     \item Results for explaining stall
% \end{enumerate}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Directly hit the point - ML based algos too many; we have tried to understand how much the ML based algos are adaptive and feasible for wide scale deployment
%     \item Move to the problems - suggest initial solution
%     \item initial solution at client split with a portion in the server - all this in first para
%     \item second stanza - implications at the system level
%     \item since complete overhauling - middlebox justification
%     \item middlebox indispensable - so where will be architectural changes; should be enumerated very clearly
%     \item how much of this can be mitigated
%     \item USP - not splitdash, but system implications of implementation: main objective and/or focus
%     \item by default stateful
%     \item Why was DASH implemented in the client side? highest penetration of HTTP/HTTPs. Large number of CDNs deployed - difficult to change, better change to client side
%     \item Less control with the client??? 
%     \item Any compromize with existing DASH philosophy? If not, then strongly justify
%     \item architecture being made more flexible without compromising on DASH philosophy
%     \item WIFI-cellular handover - discussion towards the end
