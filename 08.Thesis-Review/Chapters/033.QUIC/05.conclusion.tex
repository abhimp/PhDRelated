\section{Summary}
\label{sec:chap03:summary}
In this chapter, we have performed two different experimental studies to analyze the performance of existing \ac{ABR} algorithms from two different fronts. First, we have analyzed the dependency of \ac{ABR} algorithms on the underlying transport protocols. For this purpose, we experimented through the YouTube streaming system as well as based on an in-house lab-scale setup. Second, from an in-the-wild study, we analyzed the power consumption behavior of \ac{ABR} streaming over smartphones. From the first analysis, we observe that although there is a performance dependency on the underlying protocol stack, we actually need to tune the transport layer protocol setups to complement them with the state-of-the-art streaming mechanisms. However, from the second analysis, we observe that we need to tune the existing \ac{ABR} techniques to make them more energy-efficient. From this front, we move forward in developing an energy-efficient streaming mechanism, as discussed in the next chapter.
