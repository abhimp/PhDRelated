\section{Conclusion}
Considering the limitations of current transmission protocols for todayâ€™s diverse device and traffic characteristics, in this paper, we have developed Viscous that provides a middleware between the user application and the transport layer to handle end-to-end network characteristics. Viscous is completely compatible with the current network protocol stack, while it provides significant performance boost in the application throughput. It is developed on top of the UDP along with a set of novel features to support mobility, multi-homing and short-lived parallel and sequential flows. From the prototype implementation and performance analysis over an emulated environment, we show that the worst case performance of Viscous is similar to TCP, which indicates its applicability for a wide range of applications. 
In future, our target is to enhance Viscous with application layer QoS support to make it an alternate for both non-real time and real time traffic transport.
