\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we develop a system for edge-assisted collaborative adaptive live streaming which improves the overall QoE and the average video quality for every player. The architecture utilizes a federated platform where the streaming players form coalitions and schedule video downloads among the coalition members in a decentralized way. The proposed architecture has been implemented and evaluated over a thorough emulation platform, and we observe significant improves in overall QoE with reduction in the load at the live streaming server. In the future, we plan to explore reinforcement learning strategies to make the schedule more robust with less gossiping overhead among coalition members.
