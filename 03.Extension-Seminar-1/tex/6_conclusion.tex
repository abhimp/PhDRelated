\section{Future Work and Conclusion}
In this work we demonstrate the advantages of edge-assisted collaborative adaptive live streaming. We have shown that it improve QoE and average video quality for every player, although it need some skip in playback because of group formation. In future work, we want to improve the group formation technique in such way, so that video skip can be minimized.
